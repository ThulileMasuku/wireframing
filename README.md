## "Types of Wireframe"
Wireframes are essential tools in the user experience (UX) design process, used to visualize the skeletal structure of a digital product. There are two main types of wireframes: **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity**, each serving different purposes at various stages of design.
### What is a Wireframe?
A wireframe is a simplified visual guide that represents the framework of a website or application interface. It outlines content placement, navigation, and the overall layout without focusing on design details like colors, images, or interactive elements. Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders align early in the project by offering a clear, structured overview of the intended user experience.
### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Appearance**: Basic sketches or grayscale digital diagrams with placeholder text (e.g., "Lorem Ipsum") and boxes.
- **Purpose**: Quickly test layout concepts and basic content structure.
- **Tools**: Pen and paper, Balsamiq, whiteboards, or simple digital tools.
- **When to Use**: Early stages of design, brainstorming, or when seeking rapid feedback from stakeholders without being distracted by visual design.
### High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Appearance**: Detailed and accurate representations that resemble the final product, including typography, spacing, and sometimes interactive elements.
- **Purpose**: Validate usability, user flows, and design specifics before full development.
- **Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, or advanced prototyping tools.
- **When to Use**: Later stages of the design process, before handing off to developers or for final user testing.
### Summary
| Feature              | Low-Fidelity                     | High-Fidelity                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Detail Level         | Minimal, conceptual              | Detailed, close to final design      |
| Speed                | Fast to create                   | Takes more time                      |
| Focus                | Layout and structure             | Usability and visual accuracy        |
| Tools                | Paper, basic digital tools       | Advanced design tools                |
| Use Case             | Early ideation and collaboration | Usability testing, developer handoff |

Both types of wireframes play crucial roles in a well-structured design workflow, helping teams transition from concept to implementation smoothly.
